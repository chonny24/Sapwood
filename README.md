# Sapwood

This is a reimagining of the first game I made. The goal is to increase its scope greatly.

For a long time it is simply going to be a work in progress, but eventually it might be something cool!

### Inspiration

##### Maze
I went back and looked at my 'maze' game, which is a simple rogue-like, dungeon-crawler type game written in C++ a few years ago. All of my old ideas of how I wanted to improve it returned to me. 

In the game, loot, monsters, and a maze are completely randomly generated. It is a very simple rogue-like. Once you fight your way through the generated maze, you win! There is no story, no NPCs, no additional zones, and no quests. There are a lot of other minor improvements I want to make (inventory system, deeper combat, etc), but the mentioned unexplored elements are the main areas of development for this project.

The spirit of the game, however, is to generate a unique experience each play through with as few pre-defined elements as possible. Generation of a story, interesting NPCs, and varied quests is a challenge.

##### Starbound
I've played a bit of [Starbound](http://playstarbound.com/), and what interested me most about the game was the random generation of many, varied planets. The biomes and terrain were interesting, structures were placed on some planets somewhat randomly. Starbound randomly generated independent zones that the player could explore as they found them.

##### Dwarf Fortress
To be honest, I can't get into [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/), but I wish I could. In DF you manage a civilization of dwarves in a huge, randomly generated world and try to survive the chaos the world throws at you. The game is EXTREMELY deep with lots to learn, but civilization management games are never really my forte. The most interesting part of the game, to me, is the incredible stories the game generates. Through terrific game design, DF somehow makes a randomly generated world with monsters, goblins, and dwarves create truly unique stories. The game has stayed alive because it can create a unique, unscripted, immersive narratives with each play through. 

Dwarf Fortress is the main reason I wanted to improve on my little rogue-like. The civilization management genre isn't for me, but I really want the unique stories. Sapwood is an attempt to bring at least a taste of that to a rogue-like RPG.

### Sapwood
(Warning: cheesy name origin) 

Sapwood is the living, growing part of a tree's trunk. It expands procedurely and adapts to what is around it without a script. Though it generates and adapts, each cell still connects seamlessly to the those around it. Also it sounds like a cool name for a rogue-like.

As you could derive from above, Sapwood aims to create a rogue-like with not only a randomly generated world, loot, and monsters, but also generated NPCs, stories, and quests. The goal is to create a world and a set of stories that is immersive, each time the game is played. 

I have a Google Doc with a lot of my ideas on how I might get this to work, but I will eventually create some document in this repo with a more defined set of obtainable goals.

### How to Play
Dude, wait.
